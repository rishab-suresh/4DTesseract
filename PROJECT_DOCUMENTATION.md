# 4D Tesseract Visualization with React & Three.js

This project is a web application that renders a 4-dimensional hypercube (a tesseract) and visualizes its rotation through 4D space, projected down into a 3D view that we can see. It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [@react-three/fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber).

## Core Concepts

To understand the visualization, a few key mathematical concepts are important.

### 1. The Tesseract (4D Hypercube)

A tesseract is the four-dimensional analogue of a cube. It is generated by "extruding" a 3D cube into a new, fourth dimension.

| Dimension | Shape       | Vertices | Process                               |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| 0D        | Point       | 1        | The start                             |
| 1D        | Line        | 2        | Dragging a point                      |
| 2D        | Square      | 4        | Dragging a line                       |
| 3D        | Cube        | 8        | Dragging a square                     |
| **4D**    | **Tesseract** | **16**   | **Dragging a cube**                     |

### 2. 4D Rotation (Rotation in a Plane)

This is the most mind-bending concept. In 3D space, we rotate objects *around a 1D axis*. In 4D space, objects rotate *within a 2D plane*.

Our visualization performs a "double rotation" by rotating the tesseract's vertices in two independent planes at the same time:
*   The **XY plane**
*   The **ZW plane**

This simultaneous rotation is what creates the tesseract's complex and mesmerizing tumbling motion. We use 4D rotation matrices to calculate the new position of each vertex on every frame.

### 3. Projection (From 4D to 3D)

Since our screens (and brains) are 3D, we cannot truly "see" the 4D object. We must project it down into 3D space. This project uses an **orthographic projection**, which is like casting a direct, parallel shadow of the 4D object onto a 3D "wall". We achieve this by performing the 4D rotation and then simply ignoring the final `w` coordinate.

## How the Code Works

The visualization is primarily driven by the `app/tesseract.js` component.

1.  **Vertex & Edge Generation:**
    *   The `generateHypercubeVertices(4)` function programmatically creates the 16 vertices of the tesseract using a recursive method that simulates the dimensional extrusion described above.
    *   A set of nested loops then compares every vertex to every other vertex to find all pairs that differ in only one coordinate value. These 32 pairs become the `edges` of the tesseract.
    *   This entire generation process is wrapped in a `useMemo` hook to ensure this expensive calculation only runs **once** when the component first loads.

2.  **The Animation Loop (`useFrame`)**
    *   The `useFrame` hook from `@react-three/fiber` executes a function on every single frame of the animation.
    *   **Rotation:** On each frame, a rotation `angle` is updated. This angle is used to create 4D rotation matrices for the XY and ZW planes.
    *   **Mapping & Projection:** The code then loops through all 16 original vertices using `.map()`. For each vertex, it applies the rotation matrices to calculate its new 4D position, and then projects it into a `THREE.Vector3` by taking the `x, y, z` coordinates.
    *   **Geometry Update:** Once the new 3D positions for all 16 vertices have been calculated, the `setFromPoints()` method is used to instantly update the on-screen line geometry, creating seamless motion.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Future Ideas

*   **Perspective Projection:** Implement the perspective projection logic (described in `4D_Concepts.md`) to create a more convincing illusion of depth.
*   **User Controls:** Add sliders or mouse controls to allow the user to change the rotation speed or the planes of rotation.
*   **Face Rendering:** Extend the logic to define and render the 24 square faces of the tesseract, not just its wireframe.
